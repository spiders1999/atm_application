        // If that value is greater than the value in the account ignore that action
        // In other words if this would put the account into a negative balance do not allow it

      //On click of the depositSavings button

         //In other words if this would put the account into a negative balance do not allow it

         //Else subtract that value from the current amount in the savings account

// Bonus-- get the two accounts to work with each other and allow for overdraft protection

// Double Bonus-- This isnt very DRY.  Using the keyword "this" see if you can make the withdraw and deposit functions work for both accounts
